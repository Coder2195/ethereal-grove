We all have heard about The Twilight Forest, but it's an mod from the legacy days, isn't updated in as much as we want to, just feels like an ancient relic in general.

Minecraft datapacks have progressed quite a bunch, with useful utilities, and it's about time we brought some of that nostalgia over.

### Hence, I present you with: 
## Ethereal Grove!

This is a fan-made take of her future vision of The Twilight Forest, built entirely as a datapack. 

# Basics
You can build a portal by surrounding a 3x3 hole of water with flowers of any kind. Drop a diamond in the middle, and the portal will ignite.

To avoid intelluctal property disputes, this datapack should never be a 1 to 1 recreation of the Twilight Forest as far as whatever is possible to be replicated may be. Therefore, we will take inspiration from concepts and similar names, but we will never recreate the exact same thing with the exact same name. All content deviate to some extent.
