# Stellarity Enlightened



Stellarity Enlightened is a mod version of the total rehaul of The End including biome and structure overhauls, new
items, weapons, mechanics, mobs and more.

Explore new end cities, fight enhanced ender dragons, fish in the void, and explore new biomes and structures, now
available as a Fabric mod!

The original version you can find as [Stellarity Datapack](https://modrinth.com/datapack/stellarity/versions).

Due to unresolveable technical difficulties with integrating Forge with Fabric, the Forge port has been dropped. There
is talk about making this a Forge and Fabric split where we just steal each others code, but that is not a high priority
right now due to the lack of devs on the team.
